The whole program should be running in Jupyter, Anaconda, py3
The main directory is PMOSJ which contains directories and other files.

May need to change loading data section for the Path
e.g)
# df = pd.read_csv("../data/diamonds.csv")
# df = pd.read_csv("../Part 1 Performance Metrics in Regression/data/diamonds.csv")
